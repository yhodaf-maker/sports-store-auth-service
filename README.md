## PR Diff Review Runner

The provider-independent pipeline and trusted post-CI GitHub Actions integration are documented in [`review_runner/README.md`](review_runner/README.md). Local use accepts a supplied unified patch and uses the mock provider; the trusted reusable workflow retrieves Pull Request diffs as data and invokes OpenRouter only after deterministic CI succeeds.
